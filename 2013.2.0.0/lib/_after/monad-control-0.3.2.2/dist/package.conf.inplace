Instances are based on monad\ntransformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad\ntransformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.\n\nSee the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@\noperations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad\nthat is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.\n\nNote that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@\nlibrary. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators\nand exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to\nsimplify and speedup most definitions.\n\nThe following @criterion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@ is on\naverage about 99% faster than @monad-peel@:\n\n@git clone <https://github.com/basvandijk/bench-monad-peel-control>@", category = "Control", exposed = True, exposedModules = ["Control.Monad.Trans.Control"], hiddenModules = [], trusted = False, importDirs = ["D:\\case\\Haskell\\2013.2.0.0\\lib\\_after\\monad-control-0.3.2.2\\dist\\build"], libraryDirs = ["D:\\case\\Haskell\\2013.2.0.0\\lib\\_after\\monad-control-0.3.2.2\\dist\\build"], hsLibraries = ["HSmonad-control-0.3.2.2"], extraLibraries = [], extraGHCiLibraries = [], includeDirs = [], includes = [], depends = [InstalledPackageId "base-4.6.0.1-f0c2cc6dcf0e12bf75312a2e7f354095",InstalledPackageId "base-unicode-symbols-0.2.2.4-d8e60516914ea13736870f40778c5ac1",InstalledPackageId "transformers-0.3.0.0-df161533671a3b9bce217538864873c4",InstalledPackageId "transformers-base-0.4.1-069dd50799b89d546394b7dea920f9d4"], hugsOptions = [], ccOptions = [], ldOptions = [], frameworkDirs = [], frameworks = [], haddockInterfaces = ["D:\\case\\Haskell\\2013.2.0.0\\lib\\_after\\monad-control-0.3.2.2\\dist\\doc\\html\\monad-control\\monad-control.haddock"], haddockHTMLs = ["D:\\case\\Haskell\\2013.2.0.0\\lib\\_after\\monad-control-0.3.2.2\\dist\\doc\\html\\monad-control"]}
