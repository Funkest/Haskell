synopsis: Deep evaluation of data structures
description: This package provides methods for fully evaluating data structures
             (\"deep evaluation\"). Deep evaluation is often used for adding
             strictness to a program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions,
             remove space leaks, or force lazy I/O to happen. It is also useful
             in parallel programs, to ensure pending work does not migrate to the
             wrong thread.
             .
             The primary use of this package is via the 'deepseq' function, a
             \"deep\" version of 'seq'. It is implemented on top of an 'NFData'
             typeclass (\"Normal Form Data\", data structures with no unevaluated
             components) which defines strategies for fully evaluating different
             data types.
